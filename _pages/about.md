I am Sarath Kumar Murugan, a Bioinformatician with expertise in developing scalable pipelines and computational solutions for cancer genomics research. Currently, I work with the Prostate Cancer Research Group at the Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics (MEB), Karolinska Institutet, Sweden.

My work focuses on:

  - NGS Data Analysis: Comprehensive genomic profiling to support precision oncology.
  - Pipeline Development: Building reproducible workflows using Snakemake for accurate detection of genomic alterations.
  - HPC Administration: Managing clusters and Slurm for high-performance computing environments.

I contribute to multiple Precision Medicine clinical trials (ProBio, iPCM, PSFF) and research projects, integrating cutting-edge tools and methodologies to advance cancer genomics.

Research Interests:
  - Machine Learning & AI for Multi-Omics Integration
  - Cancer Genomics and Epigenomics
